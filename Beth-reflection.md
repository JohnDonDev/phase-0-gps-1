1. The git concepts I was struggling with prior to the GPS were the structure and flow of git. Initially, it was a confusing concept to grasp, as I was not understanding it conceptually. Now I clearly understand the flow of creating a feature branch, working, and committing your changes. I also have a better grasp of what a merge conflict is and how to avoid them.

2. The concepts that were clarified during the GPS were forking/cloning a git repository, pushing a branch to GitHub, pulling repository changes from GitHub, merge conflicts, and using good git work flow.

3. My pair and I were working together through the material, continuously conferring with one another about syntax, concepts, and opinions. We discussed what merge conflicts were, how to use fetch, what to write as commit messages, and just about anything we were doing. 

4. What still confuses me about git is how to fix a merge conflict. 

5. My first experience pairing in a GPS was very good. Although we had no guide, our work ethic was comprehensive, collaborative, and productive.
